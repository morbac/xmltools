Release 1.1.3
-------------
- Slightly change behaviour of new PrettyPrint function. The new version adds carriage returns between tags separated by only spaces and/or tabulations. This means that following code:
    <data> <test/> </data>
  will be formated as:
    <data>
      <test/>
    </data>
  Moreover, empty tags like "<data></data>" or tags which onlycontains spaces and/or tabulations will be auto-closed. For instance:
    <data> </data>
  will be replaced by:
    <data/>
- Modifiy the carriage return sequence: using "\r\n" instead of "\n"
- Fixes formating problem inside comments and CDATA blocks

- Disable "Pretty print", "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions when file is read only
- Fixes the scrolling effet which occured after "Pretty print", "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions
- Fixes the uncollapse effect which occured after "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions

Release 1.1.1
-------------
- Fix the crash bug which occured when using comment/uncomment function on XML code containing CDATA content, or other tags using <![....]> syntax.
 Warning: The new syntax for internal comments (comments inside comments) uses "<!{x}**" and "**{x}>" codes (without quotes) as markers. Since this is not same syntaxe as in previous release, you will not be able to comment/uncomment code using previous syntax. Please be careful with this feature if you used it before. Sorry for inconvenience :(
- Fix the indentation error for XML code with CDATA content, or other tags using <![....]> syntax.
