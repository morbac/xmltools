                               libcurl bindings

 Creative people have written bindings or interfaces for various environments
 and programming languages. Using one of these allows you to take advantage of
 curl powers from within your favourite language or system.

 This is a list of all known interfaces as of this writing.

 The bindings listed below are not part of the curl/libcurl distribution
 archives, but must be downloaded and installed separately.
