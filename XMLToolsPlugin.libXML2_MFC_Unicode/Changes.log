-------------------

- Change XPath Expression Evaluation window to resizable toolbox
  and make it allow user to access to editor while open

  releases. It also supports more encodings.

  parser.

- Add shortcut CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+B to "Pretty Print w/ line breaks"
  function.

- Add XML Tools  plugin installer;  this tool copies  the plugin
  into Notepad++ plugins directory and external  libXML DLL's in
  Notepad++ root directory.  External DLL's are  required by the
  new plugin version since it is based on libXML.


Release 1.1.3 (r236):
---------------------

- Slightly change behaviour of new PrettyPrint function. The new
  version adds carriage returns  between tags separated  by only
  spaces and/or tabulations. This means that following code:

    <data>  <test/>  </data>

  will be formated as:

    <data>
      <test/>
    </data>

  Moreover, empty tags like  "<data></data>"  or tags which only
  contains spaces and/or  tabulations will  be auto-closed.  For
  instance:

    <data>   </data>

  will be replaced by:

    <data/>

- Modifiy the carriage return sequence:  using "\r\n" instead of
  "\n"

- Fixes formating problem inside comments and CDATA blocks

- Fixes formating problem produced by '>' char
  (ex: "<data>test></data>" where "test>" is simple text)

- Fixes indentation errors with character '"' placed in text

- Fixes indentation errors with character '>' placed in CDATA

- Fixes encoding problems with tags using special chars (for ex.
  german umlauts) - Thanks to Christoph Wagner for this report

- Adds conversion of '&' to '&amp;' and reverse  in XML <-> text
  conversion functions 

- Adds conversion of '"' to '&quot;' and reverse in XML <-> text
  conversion functions

- Fixes the missing copy to clipboard when getting XML path from
  a tag element (getting from text position was already working)

- Disable "Pretty print", "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment"
  functions when file is read only

- Fixes the scrolling effet  which occured after "Pretty print",
  "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions

- Fixes the uncollapse effect which occured after "XML <-> Text"
  and "Comment/Uncomment" functions

- Improvement of performances + memory usage for  "XML <-> Text"
  and "Comment/Uncomment" functions

Note:  Thanks to Thomas Weller  for his bug reports  and help in
       beta testing.


Release 1.1.2 (r143):
---------------------

- Fix the misplacement error for check mark of  "Tag auto-close" 
  menu entry (the mark appeared on wrong line).

- Add a new  variant of  PrettyPrint  fonction.  The new version
  automatically adds cariage returns between tags.  The function
  is available in menu entry "Pretty Print (XML only - with line
  breaks)"


Release 1.1.1 (r124):
---------------------

- Fix the crash bug which  occured when using  comment/uncomment
  function on XML  code containing CDATA content,  or other tags
  using <![....]> syntax.

  Warning: The new syntax for internal comments (comments inside
  comments) uses  "<!{x}**" and "**{x}>"  codes (without quotes)
  as markers.  Since this  is not  same syntaxe  as in  previous
  release,  you will not be able to comment/uncomment code using
  previous syntax.  Please be  careful with  this feature if you
  used it before. Sorry for inconvenience :(
  
- Fix the indentation error for XML code with CDATA content,  or
  other tags using <![....]> syntax.

- Add a new command to perform manual XML syntax check.
